### Schools aren’t preparing students with the necessary skills of the future.

### A tech-empowered ecosystem and curriculum that’s gamified, social and relevant.

A modern approach to education
------------------------------

We believe that kids learn best by creating. By expressing their creativity, they produce something new and valuable that helps cement the formation of their knowledge.

By practicing metacognition, the act of thinking about their thinking, kids make sense of their life experiences and allow themselves to adopt the learning processes needed to fuel their passions.

We give students authorship of their learning to engage them deeply and solve problems that matter to them.

We promote collaboration to build our students' social qualities and work together to find solutions that bring about meaningful change.

We encourage our students to make mistakes. Mistakes provide personal experiential proof and are undeniable creators of knowledge.

We believe that there is always more than one way to do things and continuously strive to give meaningful variety in our approach to cater to every student.
